# Trocan-Bot
Discord bot that sends HTTP requests to a site, posts in a text channel the results and the logs in another channel.

There are plenty of commands available, such as:
- help: view available commands
- sp: set request parameters
- parameters/param: list current parameters
- reset: reset parameters to factory default
- add: add a new prompt to the list
- delete: delete the n-th prompt in the list
- undo: undo the last deletion
- prompts/list - list all prompts in the list

Request parameters and prompts modify the JSON that is sent as a payload in our requests.

Disclaimer: This project was developed with a friend in a private repository. I respect his choice to remain anonymous, so the public version of this project is uploaded here.
